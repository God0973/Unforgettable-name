# Creepy.html

Welcome to **Creepy.html** – an eerie experiment in web design.

## What is this?

This is a single HTML page designed to create a spooky, unsettling experience for visitors. The page uses a black background, red text, and a series of mysterious images paired with cryptic messages like:

- “Hi...”
- “Want to come down here...?”
- “Come here...”
- “Wanna come inside?”
- “Don't worry... It's safe.”
- “Trust me.”


## Features

- **Atmospheric Style:** Black background and red text for a creepy vibe.
- **Centered Mysterious Images:** Images appear throughout, enhancing the eerie effect.
- **Cryptic Messages:** Each image is paired with a short, unsettling line.
- **Hidden Humor:** An “Exit page” link in the corner leads to a rickroll.
- **Simple HTML & CSS:** No JavaScript required.

## Usage

Just open `Creepy.html` in your browser to experience the page as intended.

## Notes

- The page is meant for fun, pranks, or as a playful demonstration of creepy UI design.
- I don't really know what I'm doing.
